# Description

Rapid survey done in cropland fields (locally known as “shambas”) in Kenya on 12-12-2010 in the context of the RCR project (Resilience, Collapse and Reorganisation in Social-Ecological Systems of African Savannas). The survey was done in a transect between Loruk, Lake Baringo at around 1000 m a.s.l., and Churo, near to the Laikipia Plateau at around 1700 m a.s.l. The collection focussed on weeds and ruderal plants growing in the cultivated fields.
